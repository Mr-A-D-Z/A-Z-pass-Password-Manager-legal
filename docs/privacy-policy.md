# Privacy Policy — A-Z Password Manager 🔐
Last updated: 2026-02-03

A-Z Password Manager (“we”, “app”) is a password manager. Your security matters.

## What data we process ✅

### 1) Account data
- Email address (for login and account management)
- User ID (UID) generated by Firebase Authentication

### 2) Vault data (your saved passwords)
- Your vault content is **encrypted on your device before syncing**
- Encrypted vault blobs and related encrypted metadata may be stored in **Cloud Firestore**
- **We do not store your Master Password**
- We cannot read your vault contents in plain text

### 3) Support messages (optional)
If you send a bug report, suggestion, or support request from inside the app, we process:
- Your message content
- If you provide it: your contact email address
- Technical diagnostics to troubleshoot issues (for example: app version/build, device model, OS version, current screen/route, and recent in-app logs)

## Where data is stored ☁️
- Authentication: **Firebase Authentication**
- Encrypted vault sync data: **Cloud Firestore**
- Support messages & diagnostics: **Cloud Firestore**
- On-device encrypted storage: stored locally on your device (for app functionality)

## Why we use this data 🎯
- To let you sign in and manage your account
- To sync your encrypted vault across reinstalls/devices (when sync is enabled)
- To provide support and improve the app

## Sharing of data 🤝
- We do not sell your personal data
- We use Google Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore) as infrastructure providers

## Security 🔒
- Vault data is encrypted on-device before sync
- Encryption keys are kept in memory only when needed and cleared on logout/lock (where applicable)
- Optional biometric lock can be enabled in the app

## Data retention 🕒
- Account data and synced encrypted vault data are retained until you delete your account
- Support messages may be retained as long as needed to respond and improve app stability
- Deleted vault items may be kept in Trash for up to 30 days before permanent deletion (if Trash exists in the app)

## Account deletion 🗑️
You can delete your account inside the app:
**Settings → ABOUT → Delete Account**

Deletion requires:
1) Entering your Master Password  
2) Typing **DELETE** to confirm

When your account is deleted, we delete:
- Firebase Authentication user
- Firestore documents associated with your UID (encrypted vault sync + support messages)

## Children 👶
This app is not intended for children under 13.

## Changes
We may update this policy. The latest version will be published on this page.
